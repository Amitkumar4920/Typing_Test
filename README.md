## Description

The Typing Speed Checker React App is a simple and fun application that allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The app provides users with a random text prompt that they need to type as fast and accurately as possible. Once the user completes the typing task, the app calculates their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage.

This project was built using React.js and leverages modern web technologies to provide a smooth and interactive typing experience.
